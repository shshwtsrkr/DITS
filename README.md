# DITS: A New Domain Independent Text Spotter

## Introduction
DITS (Domain Independent Text Spotter) is an innovative approach to text spotting that aims to perform robustly across various domains without the need for domain-specific tuning. This project is designed to tackle the challenges of text spotting in diverse and complex environments.

## Datasets Used
Our model has been trained and evaluated on a variety of datasets to ensure its generalizability and effectiveness across different scenarios. Specifically, we have focused on two challenging domains: underwater and drone-captured images. Below are the links to the datasets used:

- [Underwater](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bccdobh2lvnZLpkUpTob-Ct5vOsdOssI?usp=sharing) - This dataset comprises images captured in underwater environments, posing unique challenges such as varying light conditions, water turbidity, and motion blur.
- [Drone](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/187jjadmLG9AQqru16u1hD4LhPiQb6xja?usp=sharing) - Aerial imagery captured using drones, characterized by high-altitude perspectives, small text instances, and multiple license plates.

The links to benchmark datasets and training scripts will be uploaded soon...
